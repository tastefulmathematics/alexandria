Concrete: Guess Who
Abstract: Using dedicated strategies rather than programmatic
Kernel: Simpler to maintain dedicated algorithms

Outline-----
Guess Who as a decision algorithm of discrete choices
Limitations of such a decision algorithms
Alternate of dedicated strategies for each possibility
Downside of such an approach
Ease of maintenance and testing
