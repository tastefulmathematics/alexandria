	Mathematics has a reputation for dealing with complicated, difficult problems.  This is unfair: simple difficult problems are fun to deal with as well.
	The Jordan Curve Theorem states: a simple closed curve in the plane divides the plan in two: an inner region and an outer region.  We need to define what a simple closed curve is, but there isnt anything nefarious hiding here.  It is just a smooth curve that is closed and doesnt intersect itself.  There is nothing complicated going on.  We simply draw a curve, make sure it ends up where it started, and that it never crosses itself.  And from this, the theorem concludes there our plan now has two distinct regions.  
	All that remains is to prove the theorem.  This is where things get difficult.  While the statement seems clear from examples, it is not clear how to proceed with a proof.  How do you prove a number of regions?  
	Looking back at the examples, they may have been deceptively simple.  The number of regions may be obvious with this simple closed curve, but how about this one?  Or this one? Or this one?  Unfortunately, this last example divides the plan into 3 regions, but that is because it is actually two simply closed curves rather than one. Whatever approach we take to proving this theorem will have to account for these concerns.
	This problem is a simple example of trying to use local information to describe global properties.  To check that we have a simple closed curve, it is enough to check that, for every point on the curve, there is a small circle centered at the point such that when the curve passes through the circle, it looks like .  Gluing local circles together then produces the global curve.  We are able to study the simple local parts, and then combine them into the potentially complicated global whole.
